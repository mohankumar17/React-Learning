2. Components - Functional and Class Components
3. JSX
4. Props
5. State - setState

## React Advanced
1. Component Lifecycle methods - Mounting, Updating, Unmounting and Error Handling
2. Fragments - avoid adding extra nodes
3. Pure Component - Only re-reders the component if difference exists between previous and current states/props. It is Class based.
4. Memo  - Similar to Pure component but it is Function based.
5. Ref - Access the DOM nodes inside react. CreateRef and ForwardRef .
6. Portals - change the hierarchy of child elements(render position).
7. Error Boundary - Class component that implements ErrorHandling Lifecycle methods. It renders alternate or fallback UI in-case of errors.
8. High Order Components(HOC) - Reusable code for the components.
9. Render Props - Similar to HOC where function is assigned to props.
10. Context - Pass data through a component tree effectively. CreateContext, context provider and consumer.
